Testing of fixed points
Epoch  1 was adjusted as a free network !                   
Epoch  2 was adjusted as a free network !                   

 Testing of the datum defekt
 Epoch 1 :  T T T F F F F
 Epoch 2 :  T T T F F F F
 Result : 
 Identical datum defect in both epochs!                      
 
Testing of the null hypothesis
Epoch 1 : Degree of freedom :     6 S0 :       1.18
Epoch 2 : Degree of freedom :     6 S0 :       1.18
test quantity :  1.00
Critical value of F-distribution :  4.28
Result: 
The basis hypothesis is accepted !!                         

!!!The conditions for a deformation analysis are fulfilled!!!
!!!An analyis is created!!!
