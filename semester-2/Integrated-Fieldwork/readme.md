# Integrated Fieldwork

2019 summer semester

A two-week (roughly) field practice (in Huelben) cooperated together with GuG students.

Fun: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

**Contents**:

* 3D reference frame via GNSS observations
* Levelling
* 3D network via total station
* Profile measurements by gravimetry
* Kinematic road survey
* Multispectral optical remote sensing
* 3D reconstruction via close-range photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning
* 3D reconstruction with UAS-photogrammetry
* Digital terrain model creation

*Tips: Enjoy!*
